Hey there Curelink Team,

Glad I reached to the solution submission round. Hope you guys like my solution and if not let me know how to do better.

Here is a simple newsletter web app I developed with Django [in 3 hours :)]. Because I have a sem exam tomorrow.

Improvements:-

The improvements I could have done is probably adding more advanced features in it, which was again a time constraint for me.


Thanks and Regards
Prithviraj Maity
